# Implementation of a multi-sig wallet using hardhat


```
This is a project made to show my understanding of solidity and core blockchain concepts.

List of Multi-sig Wallet Contract Functions-


1:function submitTransaction() 

2:function confirmTransaction()

3:function revokeConfirmation()

4:function getApprovalCount()

5:function executeTransaction()

6:function getOwners()

7:function getTransactionCount()

8:function getTransaction()




Complete documentation for the contract can be found inside the contract itself.
The functio  getTransaction() still needs to be optimized, and the testing still needs to be done.
